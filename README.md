**Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.**

The problem of computer vision appears simple because it is trivially solved by people, even very young children. Nevertheless, it largely remains an unsolved problem based both on the limited understanding of biological vision and because of the complexity of vision perception in a dynamic and nearly infinitely varying physical world.

In this post, you will discover a gentle introduction to the field of computer vision.

**After reading this post, you will know:**

=>The goal of the field of computer vision and its distinctness from image processing.
=>What makes the problem of computer vision challenging.
=>Typical problems or tasks pursued in computer vision.
